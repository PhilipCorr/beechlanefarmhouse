      <h2>Ms. Kiely, Ruislip, May 2014</h2>
      <p>I can honestly say this was the most beautiful holiday let I have had the pleasure of staying in.
        The facilities were all top notch and the surroundings were amazing.
        The house was so comfortable that we felt like we were returning home each night.
        I am already planning my return next year!</p>

      <h2>Mr. Evans, Llanon, April 2014</h2>
      <p>The location is lovely and was so peaceful.
        We were not far from a pub or from the city of Kilkenny.
        We were made very welcome.
        The accommodation is lovely and we had everything we needed.
        There was milk and a lovely apple pie in the fridge when we arrived which was a nice touch.</p>
